TODO: explain what an information silo is

## modernBrowser

## disableExtensions

TODO: explain why some extensions might block some silo loaders (future)

## browser

TODO: explain what a browser is. meh.

Also explain the difference between the utopian door to the virtual
world and that there is a war going on between browser developers that
segregates society.

## utopianDoorToVirtuality

TODO: explain, that the virtual world only consists of data and
algorithms. Explain the history of web browsers as the first try of
human kind to create a door to the virtual world and how this door has
been transformed to a television like device that restricts people in
their free choice and limits people being able to define trust
themselves.

## decentralized

TODO: explain the difference between centralized and decentralized
applications and the effects on how data is handled by such apps

## structuredData

TODO: explain difference between unstructured (raw) data and what
benefits come from structuring data.

## exchangingData

TODO: explain the difference of data storage, data transfer and data
transformation.

## wth

TODO: explain that our virtual world only works, like it works, because
people put a shitload of work into structuring and modelling the world
into algorithms and data structures. Explain, how algorithms transform
data from one structure to another in the context of computation.

Explain the difference between people who create algorithms and data
structures and their managers, who really care about your freedom of
choice and those who simply don't care or are act on the basis of
uninformed decisions.

Explain the problems of calling algorithms 'finished' and the lack of
good information about the motivation behind the development and
maintenance of algorithms and data structures and that every
algorithm or data structure is subject to change over time.

## roadmap

TODO

* implement github silo (enabling storage of bigger data blobs)
* implement signed silos (enabling freedom of trust authority)
* implement encrypted silos (enabling freedom of obscurity)
* implement silo-collaboration (enabling freedom of synchronicity)
* think about silo-settings-storage solution (creating a shitty#
  centralized data-storage for "i have no time"-people)
