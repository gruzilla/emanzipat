* visit [emanzip.at]
* create a new information silo by clicking the big button

### main goals:

* do not store any data in a centralized fashion
* allow people to learn and emancipate in their usage of software
* allow people to exchange data and manipulate it as they wish

Freedoms in danger that [emanzip.at] tries to reestablish:

1. Freedom of data locality
   = i choose, where my data is stored
2. Freedom of choosing a trust authority
   = i choose, which authority confirms or discredits trust
3. Freedom of choosing level of data obscurity
   = i choose, how semantics are derivable from my data by a machine
4. Freedom of choosing data encryption algorithms
   = i choose, which encryption algorithms are used to encrypt my data
5. Freedom of choosing data transportation tunnels
   = i choose, which hard- and software tunnels are used to transport my
   data

### glossary

The [glossary.md] explains some words that might feel foreign when using
[emanzip.at]

### console codes

Sometimes software bugs happen. That's bad, but unavoidable. Also (as
software is just a big state machine of data transformation) sometimes
software can come to a state that is not recoverable, because of various
reasons.

The [codes.md] list tries to explain all the log entries you can see in
the JavaScript console, when using [emanzip.at].
