## [emanzip.at]

A browser based decentralized structured data exchange platform.

### basic usage of free-text-silo:

no other silos are currently implemented.

* visit [emanzip.at]
* create a new information silo by clicking the big button
* choose where you want to store the information
* change the text in the block
* copy the url and send it to somebody you want to share data with

### main goals:

* do not store any data in a centralized fashion
* allow people to learn and emancipate in their usage of software
* allow people to exchange data and manipulate it as they wish

Freedoms in danger that [emanzip.at] tries to reestablish:

1. Freedom of data locality
   = i choose, where my data is stored
2. Freedom of choosing a trust authority
   = i choose, which authority confirms or discredits trust
3. Freedom of choosing level of data obscurity
   = i choose, how semantics are derivable from my data by a machine
4. Freedom of choosing data encryption algorithms
   = i choose, which encryption algorithms are used to encrypt my data
5. Freedom of choosing data transportation tunnels
   = i choose, which hard- and software tunnels are used to transport my
   data

### criticism, findings and decisions

Every software development includes decisions.
While emanzip.at tries to take as little decisions as possible and leave as many decisions as possible up to the end user, issues have come up.
Those issues are documented in [findings.md].

### glossary

The [glossary.md] explains some words that might feel foreign when using
[emanzip.at]

### console codes

Sometimes software bugs happen. That's bad, but unavoidable. Also (as
software is just a big state machine of data transformation) sometimes
software can come to a state that is not recoverable, because of various
reasons.

The [codes.md] list tries to explain all the log entries you can see in
the JavaScript console, when using [emanzip.at].
